* Input json's
  - Origin of coordinates is top-left (as in PIL)
  - Normal cores go through a tissue-detector filter

* To generate normal/tumor masks
  - We divide the json's coordinates by a scale-down factor (i.e., 64)
  - The masks are saved as PNG files
  - Spark program

* Tissue detection
  - Legacy: tissue masks are now being computed via EDDL when annotating
  - Spark program

* Fill Cassandra DB
  - It uses previously generated normal/tumor masks
  - Spark program
