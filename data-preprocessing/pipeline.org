* Input json's
  - Origin of coordinates is top-left (as in PIL)
  - Normal cores go through a tissue-detector filter

* To generate normal/tumor masks
  - We divide the json's coordinates by a scale-down factor (i.e., 64)
  - The masks are saved as png files

* Deprecated
  + xml_gen.parse() to generate xml from csv
    - serial
    - execution time: 7 minutes
  + tum_norm_masks to generate normal cores and tumoral rois masks
    - Two versions: Spark or straight python multiprocessing 
** Even older
   + tissue.tissue_gen_2() to generate tissue masks
     - Deprecated in final pipeline
     - Tissue masks are now being computed when annotating via EDDL
